# Supply Chain Emissions Modeling Using Industry and Commodity Data (2010â€“2016)

Problem Statement:

You have annual supply chain emission data from 2010â€“2016 categorized into industries and commodities. The goal is to develop a regression model that can predict the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins based on descriptive and quality metrics (substance, unit, reliability, temporal/geographical/technological/data collection correlations, etc.).

**Project Goal:**  
To analyze and predict greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from various U.S. industries and commodities using the official dataset from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/supply-chain-greenhouse-gas-emission-factors-for-us-industries-and-commodities).

**Source:**  
[Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/supply-chain-greenhouse-gas-emission-factors-for-us-industries-and-commodities)

  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

This dataset contains supply chain emission factors associated with various U.S. industries and commodities.

**Key Columns:**
- `Code`: Industry classification code
- `Industry_Name`: Name of the industry
- `Commodity`: Item or commodity name
- `GHG_Emissions_kgCO2e`: GHG emissions per unit (kg CO2 equivalent)
- `Units`: Measurement units (e.g., [kg/2018 USD, purchaser price])

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

Steps:
- Handle missing values
- Convert units where needed
- Encode categorical features
- Normalize/scale numeric columns

## ðŸ¤– Model Building & Evaluation

We aim to predict `GHG_Emissions_kgCO2e` using regression models.

Models to try:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RÂ² Score

##### Steps:
- Step 1: Import Required Libraries
- Step 2: Load Dataset
- Step 3: Data Preprocessing (EDA+Cleaning+Encoding)
- Step 4: Training
- Step 5: Prediction and Evaluation
- Step 6: Hyperparameter Tuning
- Step 7: Comapartive Study and Slecting the Best model
